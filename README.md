The following code I solved for one of the challenges HackerRank.com

Given the names and grades for each student in a class of students, store them in a nested list and print the name(s) of any student(s) having the second lowest grade.
If there are multiple students, order their names alphabetically and print each one on a new line.

Sample Input:
5
Harsh
20
Beria
20
Varun
19
Kakunami
19
Vikas
21

Sample Output:
Beria
Harsh
